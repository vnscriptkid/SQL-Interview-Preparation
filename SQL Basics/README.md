## 1. Database, SQL, Tables, Rows, Columns
- Database is a software, that allows storing data and retrieving data in a structured way.
- SQL is the kind of language to communicate with Database, interacting with data. Create, Update, Delete are most common operations.
- Data in database is organized in tables. A table is a set of related data. For example: `Users` table contains users's information ...
- Columns form shape of table, telling us what kind of information table contains. For example: `Users` table will probably have: `name`, `age`, `job` ... Columns are defined at the time creating table, but can be changed later. Each column has a type like: `varchar`, `int` ...
- Rows are actual data of table. One row corresponds to one record of data. 1 row of `Users` table would be a record about 1 specific user. 

## 2. Basic syntax
- CREATE TABLE
- INSERT INTO
- SELECT * FROM
- Calculated columns, renaming columns `AS` (aliasing)
- String operators and Functions
    - Join 2 strings: `||` or `CONCAT`
    - Casing: `LOWER()`, `UPPER()`
    - Num of chars: `LENGTH()`

## 3. Filtering Rows, Delete, Update
- `WHERE`
- Compound `WHERE`
    - `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `<>`, `!=`
    - `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `NOT IN`
- `WHERE` with List
    - `WHERE manufacturer IN ('Apple', 'Samsung');`
    - `WHERE manufacturer = 'Apple' OR manufacturer = 'Samsung';`
- Calculations in `WHERE`: :star: __Can't refer to alias in WHERE__ :star:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, price * units_sold AS total_revenue 
  FROM phones 
  WHERE price * units_sold > 1000000
  ```
- Update
  ```sql
  UPDATE phones
  SET units_sold = 8543
  WHERE name = 'N8';
  ```
- Delete
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM phones 
  WHERE manufacturer = 'Samsung';
  ```
  
## 4. SELECT DISTINCT
:question: Print the number of unique phone manufacturers

:100::smiley::100:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT manufacturer) FROM phones;
```

## 5. Utilities
:one: GREATEST

:question: ðŸ’¸ Opening price of taxi is 1$. 2$ is charged for every km. Calculate final price for all drives. 
```sql
    SELECT
        id,
        distance,
        GREATEST(1, 2 * distance) AS final_price
    FROM drives;
```

:two: LEAST

:question: ðŸ’° :money_mouth_face: All products are on sale!. Price is the least of the products price * 0.5 or $400
```sql
SELECT 
    name, 
    price, 
    LEAST(price * 0.5, 400) AS after_sale_price
FROM products; 
```

:three: CASE

:question: Print name of each product and its price. Also print a description of the price.
If __price > 600__ then __'high'__.
If __price > 300__ then __'medium'__.
Else print __'cheap'__
```sql
    SELECT 
        name, 
        price,
        CASE
            WHEN price > 600 THEN 'high'
            WHEN price > 300 THEN 'medium'
            ELSE 'cheap'
        END
    FROM products;
```
